# Project3 - SC210 August 2024 Term

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  During this project we were tasked to create an application that could pass in a .txt document with data provided by a hypothetical company 'Corner Grocer' and then assist the user with visualizing and interperating each data point to understand the frequency of items sold. We also needed to make a user-friendly menu system that would allow you to search through the items, see the frequency of each item that was captured from the .txt document, make a hystogram of the same data, and then finally allow the user to quit the application. The data had to be output on a frequency.dat file that showed the relavent data we captured as well.
  This was designed to assist the company or employees with understading the frequency of item sold within their store and assist them with multiple ways of visualizing said data. Once they completed this task though, a new file was then output to allow other applications or users to see the same data that was condensed together.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I believe I did very well on making the application easy to navigate and prevented any unnecessary errors or loops that would have prevented the user to use the application to the expected requirements. This required many compiles and application testing attempts to fulfill to ensure it made sense and worked effectively.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  The code could of been enhanced with more tools to allow the user to input more data, after the intital file was passed into the application. This would give more need for the application later. Another enhancement would be to ensure all input interactions had more secure and better input validation requirements. This would definitly imporve efficiencies and prevent the appliction from doing unnecessary tasks or crashing.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The biggest task was learning the map funconality and how it worked with both syntax and how the data was manipulated. My best and biggest resource I found was youtube.com. There is an endless supply of developers trying to expound knowledge to the view and this is one part that was new to me that wasn't much in the zybooks reading.

  Another big challenge I had was pointers which we just learned. This concept wasn't difficult to understand but to use in the matter of calling data, rather than copying data to another variable. This was very well explained in the zybooks reading but I gained a higher understanding through also youtube.com from other developers.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I have already started working on GUI Application projects that use C++ and a library called wxWidgets (OpenSource Software) to then create class objects to allow you manipulate Operating system's windows to allow users to point and click through an application rather than type everything out. Definitly my end goal when I started to learn C++ a few years ago, but never started to learn any frameworks.
  These C++ skills have also been transfered into now my new hobby, which is video game development using the Unreal Engine. This engine is coding in C++ and will allow me to keep my coding and C++ skills fresh the entire time I'm tinkering around in this environment or learning new tips or tricks.
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I used several inline comments through each step of the application. This allowed me to quickly find where I left of, like (FixMe!), or even which particular function or part of a function did for the application. I always imagine how another developer would read or fall-in on an application I have already made, but no longer maintain. I want everyone to take what I provided and run, instead of scratch their head.
